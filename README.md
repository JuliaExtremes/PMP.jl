The [World Meteorological Organization (WMO) guide](https://library.wmo.int/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=1302#.ZLlVeezMKeA) (2009) define the PMP as "the greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration meteorologically possible for a design watershed or a given storm area at a particular location at a particular time of year, with no allowance made for long-term climatic trends".

*PMP.jl* is a package to ease the estimation of the PMP through various methods:

- Moisture maximization,
- Hershfield empirical method,
- Univariate GEV method,
- Beta method.

The WMO (2009) describes in detail steps of the first two methods. The two other ones are statistical methods developped to alleviate flaws raised by the [scientific community](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/27460/modernizing-probable-maximum-precipitation-estimation).
